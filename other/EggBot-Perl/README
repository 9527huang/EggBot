Perl support for the EggBot

This is some code I've hacked together to drive the EggBot using perl scripts.
It should be fairly easy to port it to other languages if you want although
the existing Eggbot extension scripts are in Python.

EggBot.pm - this is the core module, use EggBot->new() to instantiate a new
            eggbot controller object.

HPGL.pm - Parse (simply) the HPGL language. HPGL ".PLT" files are very simple
        text files consisting of PU (pen up) and PD (pen down) commands which
        are analogs for move_to and draw_to operations. SP (set pen) sets the
        current pen color. HPGL will collect all the lines drawn by each color
        into a separate list.

egg_drive.pl - a program that uses EggBot.pm and lets you send arbitrary
            commands to the EBB. This can substitute for a terminal connection
            since it lets you send any string through.

egg_plot.pl - reads an HPGL file, and then after asking you to home the pen
            plots it. It will stop and ask for pen changes based on the 
            HP standard pen colors (for pens 1 through 8). 

preview-plot.pl - this does what egg_plot does except that rather than send
            the plot to an egg it creates a PNG (portable network graphics)
            bitmap file which represents what would have been plotted. Since
            it doesn't show the warping that occurs from the round surface
            of the egg. 

svg-test.pl - this was a test program I wrote to see if perl could parse 
            SVG files (uh doh!) and got worried that it would take too long
            to deal with two new technologies (SVG + EggBot) and reduced it
            to one (EggBot) by switching to HPGL (which many graphics programs
            support out of the box).
